PH-176858 - AC01 - Validate when landing on Wheels tray through Nav bar or CTA

Given I'm a user navigating configurator
When I navigate wheels tray
And I click on + icon below the price  to open price inventory overlay
Then the system should send a Satellite.track(“contentDisplayed”)
And it should populate the for each time clicked
